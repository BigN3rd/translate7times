# translate7times
A way to translate any English phrase seven times and back into English for the memes. Depends on libretranslatepy.

Translation route: EN -> ES -> FR -> RU -> DE -> IT -> ZH -> JA -> EN

## Example Input:
#### You think the darkness is your ally? You merely adopted the dark. I was born in it, molded by it. I didn't see the light until I was already a man, by then it was nothing to me but blinding!

## Translation:
#### What is darkness? I was born in a unified way. I see that this light is not me before being a man, but it is not blind.
